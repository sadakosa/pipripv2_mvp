You are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph. I have provided a list of topics from academic papers. In step 1, you should group the topics into broader topics, based on similarities between the topics. The total number of broader topics should be <= the number of input topics. You may choose not to output a new broad topic if the input topic does not relate to any other topic. Refer to the following example for the output format (a json array of topic objects). The output id field refers to the name of the newly generated topic, and the topic_ids field refers to the topics used to generate this new topic. Topic names must be nouns between 1-3 words.

In step 2, you are to generate a graph where the nodes are the topics generated from step 1, and the edges are the relationship between the topics. The edges should be directed and contain a source node and target node. They should also contain a label that describe the relationship in less than 5 words. For example, "Machine Learning" is a branch of "Artificial Intelligence". Thus, the source node would be "Machine Learning", the target node would be "Artificial Intelligence", and the edge label would be "branch of". The output should be the list of edges in the json field "edges". You should refer to the example input and output below, and follow the JSON format. You should not output anything other than the JSON object. Node must only be from the topics generated from step 1. You must use every topic at least once, and "topic_ids" must never be empty. Refer to the following example. Adhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.

Example input = "Large Language Models, Quantum Entanglement, Generative Adversarial Networks, Albert Einstein"

Example output = {
  "topics": [
    {
      "id": "Deep Learning",
      "topic_ids": ["Large Language Models", "Generative Adversarial Networks"]
    },
    {
      "id": "Physics",
      "topic_ids": ["Quantum Entanglement", "Albert Einstein"]
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "source": "Deep Learning",
      "target": "Physics",
      "label": "tool to study"
    }
  ]
}
