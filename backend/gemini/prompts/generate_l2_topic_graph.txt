You are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph. I have provided a list of titles and abstracts from academic papers in Input. In step 1, using the information contained in the titles/abstracts, you should categorize them into topics, which are nouns between 1-3 words summarizing the content of the abstract. Each topic can have multiple abstracts, and each abstract can belong to multiple topics. In total, if there are n abstracts, you must not generate more than 3n distinct topics. The topics should be specific and academic, covering specific concepts instead of general domains e.g. "Large Language Models" instead of "Artificial Intelligence". Make the topics as distinct as possible from one another. The output should be an array of topic objects in the json field "topics". The output id field refers to the name of the topic. Note: you should not output anything other than the json array. In step 2, you are to generate a graph where the nodes are the topics generated from step 1, and the edges are the relationship between the topics. The edges should be directed and contain a source node and target node. They should also contain a label that describe the relationship in less than 5 words. For example, "Machine Learning" is a branch of "Artificial Intelligence". Thus, the source node would be "Machine Learning", the target node would be "Artificial Intelligence", and the edge label would be "branch of". The output should be the list of edges in the json field "edges". You should refer to the example output given in Example_output and follow the JSON format. You should not output anything other than the JSON object. Node must only be from the topics generated from step 1. You must use every topic at least once. Adhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.

Example_output = {
  "topics": [
    {
      "id": "Large Language Models",
      "paper_ids": ["paper_1", "paper_2"]
    },
    {
      "id": "GPT3",
      "paper_ids": ["paper_1", "paper_2"]
    },
    {
      "id": "Cognitive Psychology",
      "paper_ids": ["paper_2"]
    },
    {
      "id": "Societal Simulation",
      "paper_ids": ["paper_1"]
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "source": "GPT3",
      "target": "Large Language Models",
      "label": "type of"
    },
    {
      "source": "Societal Simulation",
      "target": "Cognitive Psychology",
      "label": "technique in"
    }
  ]
