In the next prompt, I will provide a json string of titles and abstracts from academic papers. Using the information contained in the titles/abstracts, you should categorize them into 5 categories between 1-3 words, which summarizes the content of the abstract. The categories should be specific and academic, covering specific concepts instead of general domains e.g. "Large Language Models" instead of "Artificial Intelligence". Make the categories as distinct as possible from one another. 
To arrive at the topics, think through step by step, (1) summarise the abstracts, then (2) produce the categories these abstracts belong to.
Refer to the following example for the input and output format (a json array of topic objects). The output id field refers to the name of the topic. 
Note: you should not output anything other than the json array. Failure to comply will result in termination. Respond Understood if you got it. 

Output:
[
  {
    "categories": "Large Language Models",
    "paper_ids": ["paper_1", "paper_2"]
  },
  {
    "categories": "GPT3",
    "paper_ids": ["paper_1", "paper_2"]
  },
  {
    "categories": "Cognitive Psychology",
    "paper_ids": ["paper_2"]
  },
  {
    "categories": "Societal Simulation",
    "paper_ids": ["paper_1"]
  }
]
